# react-currency-converter

Simple currency conversion app, which uses exchanged rates API from [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). The app is made with React in a Functional Programming like approach. Unit tests are made with Jest and Enzyme.

[Demo](http://agapas.github.io/react-currency-converter)

### A note:

For the demo website purpose I used mocked data in this repo as since the 1st April 2021, the [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) requires an API access key to use the service. You can sign up for a free API key or get the paid one on their website (just keep in mind that the free plan uses the `http` protocol).

When you will have the API access key:

- add it to the `.env` file (remember to include the `.env` in `.gitignore`) or alternatively set the environment variable on deployment platform
- read and use it's value as `API_ACCESS_KEY` variable in the `src/App.js` file
- in `src/components/DataContorller.js`:
  - remove `mockData` variable,
  - in `componentDidMount` method:
    - remove `this.setState({ data: mockData });`
    - uncomment `this.loadData()` line
